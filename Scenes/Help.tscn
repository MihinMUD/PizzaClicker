text = "This is a pizza-themed idle game. 
This was made in 1 day, so this is a really basic game (the game might be too easy since I had no time to balance it).

Your goal is to make money so you can make more pizza to gain more money. Makes sense right?

To bake a pizza and sell it, just tap on the big pizza. Every pizza you sell will get added to your balance!

You can add toppings to the pizza by buying one from the tab. Adding toppings increases your pizzas' value. (This means money per pizza will go up.) 
Also, you can buy ovens that bake pizzas automatically (meaning you don't have to click anymore).

That's it! You know how to play the game! Have fun!

I am planning to add more features to this and make this an actual polished game."
